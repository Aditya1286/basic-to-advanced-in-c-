Understand how to declare and initialize variables.
Operators and Control Structures:
Learn about arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.
Understand how to use if-else statements and switch statements.
Afternoon (1:00 pm - 4:00 pm)

Intermediate Topics (2 hours)
Functions:
Learn how to declare and define functions.

Understand how to manipulate strings using array operations.
Advanced Topics (1 hour)
Pointers:
Learn about pointer variables and how to declare them.
Understand how to use pointers to manipulate memory.
Evening (5:00 pm - 7:00 pm)

Practice and Review (2 hours)
Practice Exercises:
Complete exercises on variables, operators, control structures, functions, and arrays.
Practice writing C programs to reinforce your understanding.
Review and Reflection:
Review the concepts learned throughout the day.
Reflect on what you've learned and what you need to work on.
Code Examples

Here are some code examples to get you started:

c

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
// Hello World program
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
c

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
// Function example
#include <stdio.h>

int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int result = add(5, 3);
    printf("Result: %d\n", result);
    return 0;
}
c

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit

// Array example
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int scores[5] = {90, 80, 70, 60, 50};
    printf("Score at index 2: %d\n", scores[2]);
    return 0;
}
Remember to take breaks, practice regularly, and review the concepts to reinforce your learning. Good luck!
